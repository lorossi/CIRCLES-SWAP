## What

As many times before, there is not much else to say.
I made this simple animation a while back and I thought it would be nice to share it, after forgetting about it for about a year or so.

It features a simple looping animation where circles exchange themselves in square formations, with some colour aberration sprinkled on top.

*Of course it perfectly loops over and over again.*
